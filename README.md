  just 2048 game that I chose as my first project.
write code as https://youtu.be/wOVEe9eawXc?si=6GqlJj2PQT5ik5l wrote and add buttons to it.
  Play on https://thawinxd.github.io/2048_Game/

  How to play?
First you have a board with 4 * 4 grid and two blocks with number 2 or 4 in it.
Press 'arrow key' or button to move the block in the direction your pressed.
If the number on the blocks are the same when moving and colliding with each other then the block will merge.
If you can move the blocks, one new block will add in the board.
Your goal is to get the largest number possible!!!
